Mausam is a cross-platform app that was developed using flutter. The app has been actively upgrading to provide the best user experience. It gathers data from OpenWeatherMap, via their public API. The application welcomes the user with the latest weather update screen. It gives insights about the current weather like temperature, wind speed, humidity, and many more. On the "Search" screen, it is possible to find the weather in different cities all over the world.
<br>
It also features a decent dynamic time-based UI, making it more appealing.
<br>
With the power of Flutter, Mausam runs perfectly on both Android and iOS. To be able to run this project after cloning this repository, you need to provide your OpenWeatherMap API key.
